Goal: Pretty printing an [`elm-syntax`](https://dark.elm.dmy.fr/packages/stil4m/elm-syntax/latest/) tree
in a way consistent with [`elm-format`](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format).

This could enable some cool stuff like elm-review tests not complaining about whitespace or extra parens, or as a starting point for a gren formatter.

## status
Development just started. Don't expect anything finished in a month.

## considering for the future
  - create a _very_ lenient parser
